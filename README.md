# happy hikers

A website about organizing hiking events in British Columbia. We built this website to allow individuals to go hiking through organized groups. The creators are interested in building this kind of website as we, newcomers in British Columbia, are interested in exploring the province. This would also allow newcomers to meet other people by joining our organized group hiking activities.
